## Clean Water Access Prediction Model

##### Overview: Visualized and built a predictive model in Python to estimate clean water access in underserved regions across Mexico using environmental and socioeconomic data. The goal was to identify high-risk areas where interventions could have the greatest impact.

###### Tools used: Python, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

##### Key Steps:

###### Collected and cleaned dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/water-pollution-and-disease](url))
###### Engineered features related to infrastructure, geography, and environment
###### Trained classification models and evaluated using confusion matrix
###### Visualized high-risk regions and feature importance using heatmaps and barcharts

##### Outcome:
###### Achieved ~99% accuracy on validation data
###### Visualizations helped reveal regions with poor access linked to poor infrastructure and investment
