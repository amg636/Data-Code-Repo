    "##### There was a major spike in IMR between 2006 and 2009 in the south region of Mexico and another between 2022 and 2023. Both are most likely due to socioeconomic factors, so I will compare them with other variables such as GDP per capita. In comparison to the east region, just as the south region started to decline, the east region's imr drastically increased, suggesting one may have affected the other. However, when running a permutation test, it resulted in a p-value of 0.107 which means there isn't enough evidence to conclude that one caused the other."
